# Arduino-Lightning-the-LED

In this repository, I create a program that lets me control an LED from the PC by pressing the 0 or 1 keys.
The program 
Connect an LED (not blue) to an output with an appropriate resistor
 Configure the IO as output
 Configure the serial port with baud rate 9600
 Read 1 byte from the serial port:
 If the byte is '0' turn the led off, so the led is closed
 If the byte is '1' turn the led on, so it is shining
Do this forever
